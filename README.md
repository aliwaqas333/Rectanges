## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This tool visualizes the number of possible rectagles that can be drawn given a set of dots on xy axis.

The algorithm used here can only process horizontal rectangles and does not account for rotated rectanges. I wish to integrate this feature in the future hopefully. 

Best of luck. 

enjoy
